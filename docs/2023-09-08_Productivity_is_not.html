Some of things I've noticed that feel productive but aren't. Infact some seem to take control away from you.
</p>

<h3>Utilization</h3>
Having a busy calendar doesn't necessarily mean you are productive. This will lead to constant context switching lowering the focus on any particular task.

<h3>Lack of interruptions</h3>
Feedback is an essential part of how we do things properly. Siloing yourself to work on one thing till its complete will not necessarily lead to the desired outcome.

<h3>Responsiveness</h3>
Similar to utilization but potentially worse since you can't predict when you'll need to context switch. Responding quickly to a chat notification might feel but isn't necessarily making you productive. Be careful from getting <a href="https://xkcd.com/356">nerd sniped</a>, there are bunch of very interesting problems around us, most of them don't need to be acted upon immediately.

<h3>Raw throughput</h3>
Writing thousands of lines of code isn't necessarily productive. You should care about the objective as a whole and not try to throw out <a href="https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory">features as quickly as possible</a>.
